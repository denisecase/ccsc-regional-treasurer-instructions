# CCSC Regional Treasurer Instructions

Instructions for Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges (CCSC) regional treasurers

## CCSC Treasurer

You can find contact information for current officers at <http://www.ccsc.org/board/>.

## General Duties

1. Work with conference chair to prepare conference budget when the new chair/location is chosen. 
2. Share the last few years of conference budgets with the new chair once the chair/location is announced. 
3. Submit next year's conference budget (draft) to CCSC Comptroller several weeks before your current regional conference.
4. Submit next year's conference budget (final) to CCSC Comptroller the week following your current regional conference. 
5. At the planning meeting about three months before this year's regional conference, decide on student prizes. 
6. After the planning meeting, email the CCSC Treasurer a list of gift cards / denominations needed for planned student prizes. 
7. Approve expenditures, placing them in the appropriate budget category.
8. Monitor expenditures, making sure expenditures are covered by the budgeted amount. 
   - If an item exceeds a budgeted item, explain to the CCSC Treasurer how the item is to be covered, either by using another budgeted amount or by additional income received than budgeted. 
   - You do not need to explain additional expenses due to increases in registrations for those items tied to registration, such as head tax and meals (or other items you have listed as a cost per registrant.) 
   - Also, any amount over your budget for extra meals and proceedings will automatically cover any additional expenses for meals or for proceedings.

## Before the Conference

-	If you receive any invoices, forward them to CCSC Treasurer explaining the purpose of the invoice and the budget line item they should be charged against. 
-	Agree at the planning meeting 3 months out what student prizes will be awarded. For example:
   - Student programming contest: Assumming 3 per team, awarding first prize, second prize, third prize: 3 at 90$, 3 at $50, 3 at $25. 
   - Student poster contest: 
   - Student paper contest: 

## Receiving Payments

- Conference registrations via PayPal are preferred; all information is handled automatically. 
- Checks: 
  - Conference registrations by check should be logged in a shared workbook with check date, payer, check number, date deposited, and the invoice or registration covered by this check. 
  - Then, go into ConfTool, find their registration, and check the box to mark them paid. Put check info in the comment field. 
  - Endorse checks for deposit only, sign as regional treasurer, and deposit. 
  - Send CCSC Treasurer a scan of the deposit receipt, the current spreadsheet, and a cover email so it’s clear what is included in the deposit. 
- Cash:
  - Conference registrations by cash are strongly discouraged. 
  - Wells Fargo won’t take cash deposits from anyone without signature authority on the account. 
  - If you have cash, either: 1) Use Bank of America; 2) write a check to CCSC to cover the cash and deposit the check; or 3) get a money order or similar (associated fees are a reimbursable conference expense). 

## Day of the Conference

- The conference registrar will log people in at registration and record payments. 
- Students receiving prizes must fill out the appropriate form (http://www.ccsc.org/regions/documents/). 
  - If we’re sending checks we MUST have their name, address, and phone number, legibly. 
  - If we’re giving Amazon gift cards, they must fill out a form which serves as a receipt to verify distribution of the gift cards. 
  - If you give multiple cards bundled as a single prize (e.g. a $40 prize consisting of 2 $20 gift cards), we only need a form for the amount ($40 in this example), not for each separate card. 
  - We must be able to document that if, say, $500 in gift cards were purchased as prizes, then $500 in gift cards were distributed.

## After The Conference

- Reconcile payments received against registration system records (e.g., ConfTool). 
- Reconcile total expenses and income for final regional board report. 
- Gather any invoices to be paid and forward them to the CCSC Treasurer. 
- All reimbursement requests must be accompanied by receipts and a note explaining the line item and application of each expense. 

## Required Classification of Expenses

The IRS is requiring additional information in our annual return.
The CCSC Treasurer must be able to place all expenditures into one of three
categories (tax exempt expenditures, fund-raising, or
administration.) For regional conferences, any expenses directly
related to the conference would fall under the tax exempt
category. This includes all expenses for conducting the
conference, soliciting speakers and papers for the conference,
and preparing the proceedings. Fund-raising or publicity would
include all expenses related to getting people to attend the
conference. (All expenses that result after anyone has
registered would fall under the tax exempt category.)
Administrative expenses are those related to running the
organization, such as committee meetings and communication
expenses among the committee and with any national officer. (Web
expenses will be divided equally between the exempt and fundraising categories.) 
If you are not sure where to classify a
particular item, just tell the CCSC Treasurer as much about the expense as
possible and they will classify it.

## Disbursing Funds

The procedure for the CCSC Treasurer to disburse funds is as follows:

1. The CCSC Treasurer can only disburse funds (except for advances to a college
or university or a deposit to a supplier) on the receipt of
an invoice (for which they can only pay the company issuing the
invoice), a travel reimbursement form, or a personal
reimbursement form. (Current versions of these are
available at <http://www.ccsc.org/regions/documents/>.)
2. Payments to individuals will be made only to reimburse for
expenses for which receipts are submitted (except as allowed
on the forms.) The only two exceptions to this are
honoraria to speakers and paper/poster/programming contest
awards; however these persons will need to submit an
appropriate form (a request for payment or receipt for cash,
check, or gift card.) The IRS requires that we 
report any funds that we disburse to any person who is not a
US citizen or resident.
3. Any reimbursement for travel must be submitted on a travel
reimbursement form with the person receiving the
reimbursement completing the second tab and the conference
chair completing the third tab.
4. The CCSC Treasurer will need your approval of each amount before they can
disburse the funds. Let all persons who may need to be
reimbursed know about the appropriate forms and the need for
your approval. They can e-mail the CCSC Treasurer a pdf of the appropriate
form and should copy you. Your approval needs to state
the name of the person/organization, the amount, and the
budget categories into which it fits. 
5. The CCSC Treasurer will need the address, phone number (if a check is
requested), and e-mail address of the payee to be on the
forms.
6. The CCSC Treasurer would prefer to receive electronic copies of the form.
Forms can either be submitted to you and you can forward
them on to the CCSC Treasurer with your approval, or they can be submitted
to both you and the CCSC Treasurer by e-mail where you will follow up with
an e-mailed approval. Forms can also be mailed or faxed to
the CCSC Treasurer.
7. We are not registered as an employer; thus we cannot
disburse funds to individuals (except invoiced amounts from
independent contractors) for services rendered. The CCSC Treasurer cannot
reimburse any person for such payments that they make.
Services must be invoiced directly to the CCSC Treasurer.

Make sure those associated with your region are aware of these
policies.

## Awarding Prizes

Coordinators of the student contests (e.g. programming, poster, and paper contests), 
will need to gather forms from the prize-winners when they distribute the gift card prizes. 
For copies of the required forms, see <ccsc.org/regions/documents/>.

Coordiators must get the necessary forms before gift cards can be awarded. 

Some regions determine the prize amounts at the meeting about 3 months before the conference. 
Email the treasurer with a list of gift cards and denominations and they will provide the cards. 

If asked, the CCSC Treasurer will order gift cards for use as prizes. 
If your conference chooses to award gift cards,
this reimbursement is accomplished (as for other purcheses) via
the usual expense reimbursement forms. 
For each disbursement at the conference (whether by cash, check, or gift card), a receipt
signed by the recipient must be submitted to the student contest coordinator, 
who will then submit the complete set to the CCSC Treasurer.

The Consortium has several credit cards which can be used to pay for expenses. 
You will need to authorize such uses. 
Provide contact information for the CCSC Treasurer to call the company with the numbers
and the authorization to use the card.

## Proof of Non-Profit

If someone needs a W-9 form or the EIN from the Consortium,
forward the request to the CCSC Treasurer. If you handle it, you may end up with
a 1099 form which may result in an IRS audit. The CCSC Treasurer needs to be
informed of all deposits made, along with a report that explains
the source of the funds.

## Cash Registrations

Paying for conference registrations with cash is discouraged; we recommend you do not allow cash payments. 
If you choose to allow cash, cash received at the conference can be used for prizes or any
small reimbursements, but receipts must be submitted and a report
of the source and disbursements of the cash must be submitted to
the CCSC Treasurer and to the Membership Secretary.

Cash received must either be deposited in a Consortium account or converted into a
check and sent to the Associate Treasurer with the notation that
the amount was cash received.

## Deposits

All checks should be made **payable to CCSC** and deposited in a Consortium account. 
We are subject to strict fines for not 
fully reporting all our income and expenses. 

Funds received should be deposited or sent to the Associate
Treasurer (contact the CCSC Treasurer for address if needed) within thirty days
of receipt.

If you receive a purchase order for payment, you can submit it to
the CCSC Treasurer for invoicing; the CCSC Treasurer will inform you and the Registrar when
payment is received. (Do not submit POs that are accompanied by
a check; inform the CCSC Treasurer if you receive payment before the conference.)

For each deposit you make, the CCSC Treasurer needs a PDF of the deposit slip and a
spreadsheet similar to the PayPal confirmed deposit spreadsheets
that the CCSC Treasurer will send you and the Registrar in any months in which
your conference receives a PayPal payment. 

If your deposit contains any registration funds, a copy of the spreadsheet needs
to be sent to the Membership Secretary. (This information must also 
be given to your Regional Registrar. You can add
whatever data you or the conference needs to the spreadsheet;
the CCSC Treasurer will ignore the extra information.)

Contact the CCSC Treasurer if you have any questions or need additional
information.
